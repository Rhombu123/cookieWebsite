### Setup instructions (how to run it locally)

1. Clone the repository
       Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
        git clone (repository link), this will create a local copy of the repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory
        Once repository is cloned, navigate into the project using cd cookieWebsite

3. Set up a virtual environment (recommended)
        Create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for the project.
        For macOS/Linux:
        python3 -m venv env
        source env/bin/activate
        
        For Windows:
        python -m venv env
        .\env\Scripts\activate

4. Install the required dependencies
       Now that the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary Python dependencies from the requirements.txt file by running the following command:
       pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Set up the database
       You need to set up the SQLite database for the project to work. To do this, run the following command to initialize the database:
       python app.py

6. Run the application
       Now that everything is set up, you can start the Flask development server. Run the following command:
        flask run
        The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000

###  Deployment Instructions

1. Deploy to Render
Every time you push to the main branch, the CI/CD pipeline will automatically deploy your app. The steps for this are included in the GitHub Actions workflow. However, if you want to manually trigger a deploy, you can do so via the Render API by sending a POST request with the following command (configured in your GitHub Actions workflow):

```yaml
curl -X POST https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d0e1q4c9c44c73cgpfu0/deploys \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.project_scrt }}"
```

2. GitHub Actions for Deployment
The GitHub Actions workflow automatically triggers a deployment when code is pushed to the main branch. You can check the status of the build and deployment process in the GitHub Actions tab of your repository.
